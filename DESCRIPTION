Description: An R-package Agro-Climatic Data by County (*acdc*) is designed to provide a county level
base dataset and canned functions for use in agricultural production and climate/weather research. 
Due to the recent popularity of raster imagery data (high resolution grid cell data), the demand for 
weather, soil/land and related data for research and applied decision support is increasing rapidly. 
The *acdc* is developed to provide the most widely-used variables extracted from the most popular high
resolution gridded data sources to end users of agro-climatic variables who may not be equipped to 
process large geospatial datasets from multiple publicly available sources that are provided in 
different data formats and spatial scales. Annual county level data are provided for 
corn, soybeans, upland cotton and winter wheat yields, and customizable growing degree days and 
cumulative precipitation for two groups of months (March-August and April-October) to capture 
different growing season periods for the crops. Soil characteristic data are also included for each 
county in the data set. All weather and soil data have been processed based on land cover/land use 
data and exclude soil and weather data for land that is not being used for non-forestry agricultural 
uses.
